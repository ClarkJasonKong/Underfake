				<h1>
					From you, a year ago
				</h1>
				<p>
					Last Christmas, I spent the event alone,
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					Sprawling on bedding, in an ill-lit room.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_2">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					Reeking of desperation; <br>
					Seeping with anxieties; <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					No hope, can't even mention, <br>
					by rapid-fire irrationalities.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_3">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					then,
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_4">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					You came out of nowhere, <br>
					as the last person I'd expect. <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					behind my friends, family, <br>
					or even my best friend. 
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_5">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					A mere mini mesage, <br>
					made me merry, it managed. <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					Maybe most mistakes, must <br>
					only have moments of mileage?
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_6">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					One needn't be happy, <br>
					specially during a holiday. <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					"It's human to be melancholy."<br>
					that's what you had me say.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_7">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					A year has passed, <br>
					and our positions have switched, <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					and all i can say,<br>
					is life is strangely a bitch.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_8">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					"Are you alright?" i ask you worriedly. <br>
					You reply, "No, but i will be, eventually."<br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					Though i wish for you to be dearly happy, <br>
					I learned from you, one also needn't hurry.

				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_9">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
					as we approach the new year, <br>
					i hope you won't think of this as lame, <br>
					<div class="linebreak"></div>
					but know that your friends wil be there, <br>
					wishing for you the same.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="section" id="child_10">
			<div class="fixed">
				<p>
						and i will be here, <br>
						waiting for your smile again.
					</p>
				<div id="ghost">
